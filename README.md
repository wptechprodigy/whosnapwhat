# WhoSnapWhat

It uses [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) API to fetch photos based on user search term. It provides the following information about the fetched images:

* Name of photographer

* Number of views

* Number of people who favourite it

* Number of downloads

* Number of likes

You can also go to the profile of the Pixabay user to see who s/he is...just incase you might be interested in her/his work. Just click on the user's name!

## Project Details

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It was styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

I used the lates React hooks like **useState and useEffect**. I also made a **custom hook** to make the data fetching from any source generic and reusable.

I will be improving on this code base to implement my knowledge of React as I move on.

I hope you find this interesting...

It is to me. It was fun building it.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
